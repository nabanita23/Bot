useState hook syntax was incorrect. It should be useState(initialState), where initialState is the initial state value of your state variable. There shouldn't be any colons or types specified in the useState call.
The return type of useState hook is inferred from the initial state value passed to it, so there's no need to specify it explicitly in most cases. However, if you want to specify it, you should do it after the useState call, not before.
In React function components, the return type of setState is not React.Dispatch<React.setState>. It's just React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<S>>, where S is the type of your state variable. So, there's no need to specify the return type of setCount explicitly in most cases.
